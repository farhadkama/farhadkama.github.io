When and where do large cracks grow?

No matter how simple it may seem, this question is a long-standing problem in mechanics. Our latest publication, “When and where do large cracks grow? Griffith energy competition constrained by material strength,” is our attempt to address this century-old problem. This is a crucial first step in a new direction for us.

I am excited to share that the paper has just been published in *Extreme Mechanics Letters* (EML) and can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eml.2025.102417).

I know he may not see this post, but I would like to congratulate my Ph.D. advisor, Prof. Oscar Lopez-Pamies, on the publication of his 100th paper! Having experienced his mentorship, I know the extraordinary effort and dedication that underlie every single one of these publications.
