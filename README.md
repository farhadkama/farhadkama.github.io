# Farhad Kamarei - Computational Mechanics & Fracture Mechanics Research

Welcome to my academic website repository. This site showcases my research in **phase-field modeling**, **fracture mechanics**, and **computational mechanics** with applications to soft materials, elastomers, and advanced materials.

## Research Focus

I am a computational mechanicist specializing in:

- **Phase-Field Modeling**
- **Fracture Mechanics**
- **Phase-Field Fracture**
- **Computational Methods**
- **Soft Material Mechanics**
- **Nonlinear Mechanics**
- **Viscoelastic Materials**

## Key Research Areas

### Finite Element Implementation
- FEniCSx/FEniCS-based solvers for PDEs in mechanics
- Viscoelasticity and time-dependent material behavior

## Research Repositories

This GitHub account hosts numerous computational tools and implementations related to fracture mechanics and phase-field modeling:

### Core Software Projects

- **[FEniCSx_Kamarei_Kumar_Lopez-Pamies](https://github.com/farhadkama/FEniCSx_Kamarei_Kumar_Lopez-Pamies)**: Educational introduction to phase-field fracture modeling with simple, well-commented code covering seven fundamental test cases (cylindrical hole, single edge notch, surfing, indentation, compact tesnsion shear, Brazilian, and poker-chip tests) for elastic brittle materials.

- **[FEniCSx_Kamarei_Lopez-Pamies](https://github.com/farhadkama/FEniCSx_Kamarei_Lopez-Pamies)**: Professional framework providing complete mesh generation and simulation tools for nine benchmark tests that systematically explore the entire fracture envelope across different loading modes and nucleation conditions.

- **[FEniCSx_Kamarei_Sozio_Lopez-Pamies](https://github.com/farhadkama/FEniCSx_Kamarei_Sozio_Lopez-Pamies)**:  Educational codebase focusing on finite deformation viscoelasticity for modeling fracture in polymers and time-dependent materials, implementing a computational approach to sharp-fracture theory.
